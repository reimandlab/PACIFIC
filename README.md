# PACIFIC - Predict and Analyze Combinations of Interacting Features In Cancer

This pipeline enables exploring the interactions between two types of multi-omic features in relation to cancer patient outcomes. The pipeline runs an iterative procedure consisting of subsampling, feature preprocessing and elastic net regularization of the multivariate models to identify the most frequently selected interactions across the iterations. These candidate interactions are a minimal subset of input interactions with robust explanatory information. Additionally, the pipeline outputs a series of ANOVA p-values to highlight the significant interactions, controlling for main effects and baseline covariates.

## Installation
Dependencies: 
- `glmnet`
- `survival`
- `ggplot2`

Clone the repository, then run the following command in R: `install.packages("path/to/PACIFIC", repos = NULL, type = "source")`.

## Usage
In this example, PACIFIC is applied to a dataset of 463 TCGA-LUSC primary tumors annotated with clinical variables, mutational status of cancer driver genes, and relative abundance of immune cell types in tumors (see IGX paper for data collection details). Here, we define the patient outcome of interest as **overall survival**, the first feature set (`feat1`) as the mutational status of driver genes, the second feature set (`feat2`) as the immune cell levels, and the `baseline` variables as patient age, sex, and tumor stage. For simplicity, we use a small portion of the available feature sets in this example.

```R
library(PACIFIC)

####
# Using the dataset included in the PACIFIC package. 
####

fname_data <- system.file("extdata", "example_dataset.rds", package = "PACIFIC")
data <- readRDS(fname_data)

####
# Define the baseline and the two sets of features.
####

baseline <- c("age", "sex", "stage")
feat1 <- c("TP53", "KMT2D", "CDKN2A", "KRAS")
feat2 <- c("B_cells_memory", "Plasma_cells", 
           "Macrophages_M1", "Macrophages_M2", 
           "Monocytes", "NK_cells_activated", 
           "T_cells_CD8","T_cells_regulatory_Tregs")

PACIFIC pipeline runs in two steps:
- **Step 1**: To run the iterative procedure. This step can be repeated through independent calls to accumulate the desired **total** number of iterations in a specified output directory, enabling parallel runs. See the **'Scalability'** section for more information.
- **Step 2**: To aggregate the resutls of all iterations accumulated in the output directory. At this step, the candidate interactions (those selected in â‰¥50% of iterations) are identified, and their ANOVA p-values are calculated. The 50% cutoff can be adjusted by the user.

```R

The KM plots for the top interactions are stored in a named list in the `$km_plot_list` facet of `results`. View the KM plots for the "KMT2D*Monocytes" interaction:
```R
plot(results$km_plot_list[['KMT2D*Monocytes']])
```

### Notes
- We recommend highlighting only the interactions for which all of the following ANOVA tests are significant after FDR correction (available in `results$top_interactions`):
   - `intr_P`: interaction *vs.* baseline
   - `intr_P_C1`: interaction *vs.* baseline + feat1
   - `intr_P_C2`: interaction *vs.* baseline + feat2
   - `intr_P_C3`: interaction *vs.* baseline + feat1 + feat2
- By default, each feature in `feat1` and `feat2` is treated according to the following rules:
   - If it is categorical, it must be `factor` with two levels. In this case, the second level is considered as the "active" state. In other words, only the second level may contribute to any potential interaction.
   - If it is continuous (`numeric`), it is converted into high or low levels (within each iteration of feature selection) based on `> median` or `<= median`, respectively. In this case, both high and low levels may contribute to any potential interaction.
- Usually more than 1000 iterations are needed for stable results (depending on the complexity of the input data).

## Scalability
You can **repeat** the **Step 1** of PACIFIC through independent calls of the function to accumulate the desired total number of iterations **in the same output directory**. To do so, please note the following:
- Each call of **Step 1** must be given a unique `job_id` argument. Any call that reuses a previously used job index for the given output directory is prevented with an error message.
- Other than `job_id`, `num_iterations`, and `verbose`, all arguments to the **Step 1** call must remain consistent across the repeated calls. Any inconsistent call for the given output directory is prevented with an error message.
- Once the desired total number of iterations has been reached, the **Step 2** function should be called for the given output directory to aggregate the iterations and produce the final results.
